## Features

- User authentication and session management with Passport.js.
- CSV data import for logging blood sugar levels and other health metrics.
- Visualization of blood sugar levels, insulin intake, and nutritional information using Plotly.
- Integration with Twilio for sending SMS reminders to users.
- Web scraping of nutritional data from MyFitnessPal using Cheerio.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for routing and server setup.
